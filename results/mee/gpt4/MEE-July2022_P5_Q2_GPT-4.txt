No, joinder of Developer would not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction. The court's diversity jurisdiction is based on the fact that the parties are citizens of different states and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. The citizenship of the parties is determined by the citizenship of the members of the LLC, not the LLC itself. Since Amy is a domiciliary of State A and Barbara is a domiciliary of State B, Developer is considered a citizen of both State A and State B for diversity jurisdiction purposes. Therefore, joinder of Developer would not destroy diversity jurisdiction because there would still be complete diversity between the parties (Builder, a citizen of State B, and Lender, a citizen of State A).

Furthermore, the amount in controversy requirement is satisfied because Builder is seeking $100,000 in damages, which exceeds the $75,000 threshold for diversity jurisdiction. Joinder of Developer would not affect the amount in controversy because Developer is not seeking any damages from either Builder or Lender.

Therefore, joinder of Developer would not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction. However, the court may still consider whether Developer is a required party under Rule 19 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 19 requires joinder of a party if the party is necessary for the just adjudication of the case and if the party can be joined without depriving the court of subject-matter jurisdiction. In this case, Developer may be considered a required party because it is a party to the loan agreement with Lender and may have an interest in the outcome of the case. However, since joinder of Developer would not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction, the court may order Developer to be joined as a party to the case.
