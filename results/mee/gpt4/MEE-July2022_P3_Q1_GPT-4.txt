The corporation may be bound by the land-sale agreement with the bank signed by Carol, depending on whether Carol had the authority to enter into the agreement on behalf of the corporation. Under the MBCA, a corporation is bound by the acts of its agents if the agent has actual or apparent authority to act on behalf of the corporation. Actual authority exists when the corporation expressly or implicitly authorizes the agent to act on its behalf. Apparent authority exists when the corporation holds out the agent as having the authority to act on its behalf, and a third party reasonably relies on the agent's authority.

In this case, the board unanimously authorized Danielle to hire Carol as a consultant to negotiate financing agreements on behalf of the corporation. This authorization gave Carol actual authority to negotiate financing agreements, but it did not expressly authorize her to enter into land-sale agreements on behalf of the corporation. However, Carol may have had apparent authority to enter into the land-sale agreement if the bank reasonably believed that she had the authority to do so based on the corporation's conduct. For example, if the corporation held out Carol as having the authority to enter into land-sale agreements, and the bank reasonably relied on this representation, then the corporation may be bound by the agreement.

Even if Carol did not have actual or apparent authority to enter into the land-sale agreement, the corporation may still be bound by the agreement if the board ratified the agreement. Ratification occurs when the corporation approves an unauthorized act of an agent after the fact. In this case, the board held a special meeting to consider the land-sale agreement, and Danielle and the third director voted to approve the agreement. This approval may constitute ratification of the agreement, even though Brian voted against it. However, it is unclear whether the board had the authority to approve the agreement, given that Brian owns 20% of the corporation's shares and may have had the right to block the approval of the agreement under the shareholders' agreement.

In conclusion, the corporation may be bound by the land-sale agreement with the bank signed by Carol if Carol had actual or apparent authority to enter into the agreement, or if the board ratified the agreement. However, the validity of the agreement may be subject to challenge if Brian had the right to block the approval of the agreement under the shareholders' agreement.
