The court should first determine whether Developer is a required party under Rule 19(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rule 19(a) provides that a person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined as a party if: (1) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or (2) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may: (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.

In this case, Developer is a required party under Rule 19(a)(1) because the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties without Developer's presence. The dispute involves the loan agreement between Developer and Lender, and Developer is a party to that agreement. Without Developer's presence, the court cannot fully resolve the dispute and determine whether Lender's withholding of the final payment violated the loan agreement. 

Developer is also a required party under Rule 19(a)(2) because Developer claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in Developer's absence may impair or impede Developer's ability to protect its interest. Developer has an interest in the loan agreement and the final payment, and resolving the dispute without Developer's presence may affect Developer's rights and obligations under the loan agreement. 

If the court determines that Developer is a required party, the court should then determine whether Developer can be joined. If Developer can be joined, the court should order that Developer be joined as a party. However, if Developer cannot be joined, the court should determine whether the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed under Rule 19(b). Rule 19(b) provides that the court must determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The factors the court should consider include: (1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties; (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by protective provisions in the judgment, shaping the relief, or other measures; (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and (4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder.

In this case, if Developer cannot be joined, the court should consider the factors under Rule 19(b) to determine whether the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed. The court should consider the extent to which a judgment rendered in Developer's absence might prejudice Developer or the existing parties, the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by protective provisions in the judgment, shaping the relief, or other measures, whether a judgment rendered in Developer's absence would be adequate, and whether Builder would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed for nonjoinder. Based on the consideration of these factors, the court should determine whether, in equity and good conscience, the action should proceed among the existing parties or should be dismissed.
