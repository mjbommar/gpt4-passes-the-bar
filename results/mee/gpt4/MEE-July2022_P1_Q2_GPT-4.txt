The trial court should deny the defendant's motion to exclude the photograph of Defendant's tattoo and the former gang leader's anticipated testimony about it as inadmissible character evidence. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character. However, such evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.

In this case, the photograph of Defendant's tattoo and the former gang leader's testimony about it are not being offered to prove Defendant's character, but rather to prove his membership in The Lions gang, which is relevant to the prosecution's theory that the shooting was the result of a gang dispute. The evidence is also relevant to proving Defendant's motive and intent to commit the crime, as it supports the prosecution's theory that Defendant was acting on behalf of the gang and in accordance with its codes of behavior. Therefore, the evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b) for these purposes.

Furthermore, under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, the court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. In this case, the probative value of the evidence is high, as it is directly relevant to the prosecution's theory of the case and supports the testimony of the victim. The danger of unfair prejudice is also low, as the evidence is not being offered to prove Defendant's character, but rather his membership in the gang and his motive and intent to commit the crime. Therefore, the evidence should not be excluded under Rule 403.

In conclusion, the trial court should deny the defendant's motion to exclude the photograph of Defendant's tattoo and the former gang leader's anticipated testimony about it as inadmissible character evidence, as the evidence is admissible under Rules 404(b) and 403 for the purposes of proving Defendant's membership in the gang and his motive and intent to commit the crime.
