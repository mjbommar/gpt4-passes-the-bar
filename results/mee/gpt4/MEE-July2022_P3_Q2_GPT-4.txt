The bonus payment made to Danielle, which was approved by a majority of the board of directors, was not proper. Under the MBCA, directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. This includes a duty of loyalty, which requires directors to avoid conflicts of interest and to refrain from self-dealing. The MBCA also requires that directors act with the care that a reasonably prudent person would use in similar circumstances.

In this case, the bonus payment to Danielle was a clear violation of the duty of loyalty. The payment was made solely to Danielle, who owned 80% of the corporation's shares, and not to any other shareholders, including Brian, who owned 20% of the shares. This is a clear example of self-dealing, as Danielle used her position as a director to benefit herself at the expense of the other shareholders.

Furthermore, the bonus payment was not made in the best interests of the corporation. The proceeds from the sale of the parcel were meant to be used for the corporation's business purposes, as agreed upon by the board. The decision to distribute all of the sale proceeds to Danielle as a "bonus payment" was not in line with the corporation's purpose and was not a reasonable use of the corporation's funds.

The fact that the bonus payment was approved by a majority of the board of directors does not make it proper. The MBCA requires that directors act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders, regardless of whether a majority of the board approves of their actions. In this case, the majority of the board, including Danielle and the third director, acted in violation of their fiduciary duties by approving the bonus payment to Danielle.

Therefore, the bonus payment made to Danielle was not proper and was a violation of the directors' fiduciary duties under the MBCA.
