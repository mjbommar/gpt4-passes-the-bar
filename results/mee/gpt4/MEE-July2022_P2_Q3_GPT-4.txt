Yes, Buyer would likely prevail on a claim that Seller breached her obligations under the agreement by opening her new winery. The agreement between Buyer and Seller included a provision that Seller was not permitted to own or operate a winery anywhere in the United States for 10 years after the closing. This provision is known as a non-compete clause and is enforceable under the common law of contracts if it is reasonable in scope and duration. In this case, the non-compete clause is reasonable in both scope and duration, as it only prohibits Seller from owning or operating a winery in the United States for 10 years. Therefore, Seller's decision to open and operate a winery in another state in the United States is a clear breach of the non-compete clause in the agreement.

Seller may argue that the non-compete clause is unenforceable because Buyer breached his obligations under the agreement by discontinuing the use of the red wine label with Seller's picture and by only paying Seller 5% of the winery's profits during the first year of his ownership. However, these arguments are unlikely to succeed. First, the agreement did not include any provision about future use of the red wine label with Seller's picture, so Buyer's decision to discontinue using the label is not a breach of the agreement. Second, the agreement only required Buyer to pay Seller a "fair share" of the winery's profits during the first year of his ownership, and did not specify a specific percentage. Therefore, Buyer's decision to pay Seller 5% of the winery's profits is not a breach of the agreement.

In conclusion, Buyer would likely prevail on a claim that Seller breached her obligations under the agreement by opening her new winery, as Seller's actions are a clear violation of the non-compete clause in the agreement.
