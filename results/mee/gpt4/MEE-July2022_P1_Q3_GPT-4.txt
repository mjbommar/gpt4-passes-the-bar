The trial court should deny the defendant's motion that Victim's anticipated testimony that Defendant shot him because of a gang dispute is irrelevant. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, relevant evidence is defined as "evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Fed. R. Evid. 401. In this case, the fact that Defendant shot Victim because of a gang dispute is relevant to the prosecution's theory that the shooting was the result of a gang dispute. The testimony by Victim directly supports the prosecution's theory and makes it more probable that the shooting was the result of a gang dispute. Therefore, the testimony is relevant and should be admitted.

Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Evidence provide that "all relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court pursuant to statutory authority." Fed. R. Evid. 402. There is no indication that the Victim's testimony is inadmissible under any of these exceptions. Therefore, the trial court should deny the defendant's motion and allow the Victim's testimony to be admitted.

It is important to note that the trial court has the discretion to exclude relevant evidence "if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence." Fed. R. Evid. 403. However, in this case, there is no indication that the Victim's testimony would be unfairly prejudicial, confusing, misleading, or a waste of time. Therefore, the trial court should not exclude the Victim's testimony on these grounds.

In conclusion, the trial court should deny the defendant's motion that Victim's anticipated testimony that Defendant shot him because of a gang dispute is irrelevant. The testimony is relevant and admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, and there is no indication that it should be excluded under Rule 403.
