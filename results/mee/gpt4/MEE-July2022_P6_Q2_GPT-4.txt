Upon conveying the apartment building to Frank, Oscar had a possibility of reverter in the apartment building. This is because the conveyance was subject to a condition subsequent, which is a condition that, if not met, allows the grantor to retake the property. In this case, the condition subsequent was that at least four apartments in the apartment building must be rented to families with incomes below the state median income for a family of their size. If this condition was not met, the apartment building would automatically revert back to Oscar.

The possibility of reverter is a future interest that is created in the grantor when a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is conveyed. It is a type of reversionary interest, which means that it is an interest that reverts back to the grantor upon the occurrence of a specified event. In this case, the specified event is the failure to rent at least four apartments to below-median-income families.

The possibility of reverter is valid under the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, which provides that no interest is valid unless it must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of some life in being at the creation of the interest. The possibility of reverter is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities because it is a reversionary interest, and reversionary interests are exempt from the Rule. Therefore, Oscar's possibility of reverter in the apartment building was valid.

However, it is important to note that the jurisdiction has adopted the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP), which modifies the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. Under the USRAP, an interest is valid if it either (1) vests within 90 years of its creation, or (2) is validated by the common law Rule Against Perpetuities. Because Oscar's possibility of reverter is valid under the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, it is also valid under the USRAP. Therefore, Oscar had a valid possibility of reverter in the apartment building upon conveying it to Frank.
