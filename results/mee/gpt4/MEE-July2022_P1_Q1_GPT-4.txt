The trial court should deny the defendant's motion and allow the detective's anticipated testimony about gang identification, organization, and activities as proper expert testimony. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, a witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if: (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.

In this case, the detective is qualified as an expert by his knowledge, experience, training, and education in the area of gang identification, organization, and activities. He has been a detective on the police force for six years, with a primary assignment of investigating gangs and criminal activity in City. He has also worked closely with federal drug and firearm task forces as they relate to gangs. Prior to becoming a detective, he was a corrections officer in charge of the gang unit for City's jail for three years, and his duties included interviewing, investigating, and identifying gang members. Additionally, he has attended training sessions providing education and information on gang structure, membership, and activities, and has frequently been asked to lead such sessions.

The detective's testimony will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence and to determine a fact in issue, namely, whether Defendant is a member of The Lions gang and whether the shooting was the result of a gang dispute. The detective's testimony is based on sufficient facts or data, as he is familiar with The Lions and has knowledge of their symbols, codes, and activities. The testimony is also the product of reliable principles and methods, as the detective has gained his knowledge and experience through his work as a detective and corrections officer, as well as through his attendance and leadership of training sessions. Finally, the detective has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case, as he is able to identify the symbols and codes used by The Lions and can explain their significance.

Therefore, the trial court should deny the defendant's motion and allow the detective's anticipated testimony about gang identification, organization, and activities as proper expert testimony.
