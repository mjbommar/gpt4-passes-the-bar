Upon Oscar's death, Wanda does not have any interest in the apartment building. The apartment building was validly conveyed to Frank and his heirs so long as at least four apartments in the building are rented to families with incomes below the state median income for a family of their size. This conveyance created a fee simple determinable in Frank, with a possibility of reverter in Oscar. A fee simple determinable is an estate that automatically terminates upon the happening of a specified event and reverts back to the grantor. Here, the specified event is if fewer than four apartments are being rented to below-median-income families. The possibility of reverter is the interest that the grantor retains in the property, which gives the grantor the right to retake possession of the property if the specified event occurs.

Since Oscar died before the specified event occurred, the possibility of reverter passed to his heirs or devisees under his will. However, Oscar's will does not mention the apartment building or the possibility of reverter. The only provisions in Oscar's will are the ones giving the family home to Wanda for life, with a remainder to Adele and her heirs, and the residue of his estate to Wanda. Since the possibility of reverter is not part of the residue of Oscar's estate, it does not pass to Wanda under the second provision of Oscar's will. Therefore, Wanda does not have any interest in the apartment building upon Oscar's death.

Furthermore, the conveyance of the apartment building to Frank and his heirs is valid under the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP). The USRAP provides that a nonvested property interest is invalid unless it is certain to vest or terminate no later than 21 years after the death of an individual who was alive when the interest was created. Here, the fee simple determinable in Frank and the possibility of reverter in Oscar are both vested property interests, so they are not subject to the USRAP. Therefore, the conveyance of the apartment building to Frank and his heirs is valid.
