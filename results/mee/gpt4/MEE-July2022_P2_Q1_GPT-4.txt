The enforceability of the oral agreement between Seller and Buyer regarding the use of Seller's picture on red wine labels depends on whether the written agreement between the parties was intended to be a complete and final expression of their agreement. If the written agreement was intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement, then the oral agreement regarding the use of Seller's picture on red wine labels would not be enforceable because it was not included in the written agreement. This is known as the parol evidence rule, which generally prohibits the introduction of evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict or vary the terms of a written agreement.

However, if the written agreement was not intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement, then the oral agreement regarding the use of Seller's picture on red wine labels may be enforceable. In this case, the parties' oral agreement could be considered a collateral agreement that is separate and distinct from the written agreement and, therefore, not subject to the parol evidence rule.

In this case, the written agreement between Seller and Buyer did not include an "integration" or "merger" clause, which would indicate that the written agreement was intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement. Additionally, the written agreement did not include any provision about the future use of the red wine label with Seller's picture, despite the fact that Seller and Buyer had orally agreed to this term during their negotiations. These facts suggest that the written agreement was not intended to be a complete and final expression of the parties' agreement and that the oral agreement regarding the use of Seller's picture on red wine labels may be enforceable as a collateral agreement.

Furthermore, the fact that Seller and Buyer both understood and agreed to the term regarding the use of Seller's picture on red wine labels during their negotiations supports the enforceability of the oral agreement. The parties' mutual understanding and agreement to this term indicates that it was an important part of their overall agreement and should not be disregarded simply because it was not included in the written agreement.

In conclusion, the oral agreement between Seller and Buyer regarding the use of Seller's picture on red wine labels may be enforceable as a collateral agreement, despite the fact that it was not included in the written agreement. The absence of an integration or merger clause in the written agreement and the parties' mutual understanding and agreement to the term during their negotiations support the enforceability of the oral agreement.
