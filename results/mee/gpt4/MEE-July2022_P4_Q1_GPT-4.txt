1.(a) The AD Trust was validly created when Arlene bought the bonds with her personal funds and revised Schedule A to list them as assets of the trust. This is because a valid trust requires three elements: (1) a settlor (Arlene), (2) a trustee (Arlene), and (3) a res or trust property (the bonds). Prior to the purchase of the bonds, the AD Trust did not have a res or trust property, as Arlene had not transferred any assets to the trust. However, once she bought the bonds and listed them as assets of the trust, the AD Trust had all three elements necessary for a valid trust.

1.(b) The AD Trust was effectively revoked when Arlene wrote across the face of the Declaration of Trust, "This AD Trust is revoked" and "I'm taking back the assets." Under the Uniform Trust Code, a settlor may revoke or amend a revocable trust unless the terms of the trust expressly provide that the trust is irrevocable. Here, the trust instrument had no provision regarding whether it was revocable or irrevocable. Therefore, the AD Trust was revocable and Arlene had the power to revoke it. By writing "This AD Trust is revoked" and "I'm taking back the assets" on the Declaration of Trust, Arlene effectively revoked the AD Trust and took back the assets. This means that the bonds and the necklace were no longer part of the AD Trust and were instead part of Arlene's personal property.
