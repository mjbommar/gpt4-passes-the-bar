As between Wanda and Frank, Wanda is obligated to pay the property taxes on the family home. This is because Wanda holds a life estate in the family home, which gives her the right to possess and use the property during her lifetime. As the holder of a life estate, Wanda is responsible for paying the property taxes on the family home during her lifetime. This is a common law principle known as the "duty to pay taxes" that is imposed on life tenants. The duty to pay taxes requires the life tenant to pay all taxes and assessments on the property during the term of the life estate.

Frank, on the other hand, holds a remainder interest in the family home, which gives him the right to possess and use the property after Wanda's death. As the holder of a remainder interest, Frank is not responsible for paying the property taxes on the family home during Wanda's lifetime. The duty to pay taxes does not apply to remaindermen, as they do not have the right to possess and use the property during the term of the life estate.

It is true that Adele had regularly paid the property taxes on the family home before her death, but this does not change the fact that Wanda is the one who is legally obligated to pay the property taxes. Adele's payment of the property taxes was a voluntary act on her part and did not create any legal obligation for Frank to continue paying the property taxes after her death.

Frank's suggestion that Wanda could move out of the home and rent it to another in order to generate rental income to pay the property taxes is not relevant to the question of who is legally obligated to pay the property taxes. While it may be a practical solution for Wanda to generate income to pay the property taxes, it does not change the fact that Wanda is the one who is legally obligated to pay the property taxes during her lifetime.

Therefore, as between Wanda and Frank, Wanda is obligated to pay the property taxes on the family home.
