Yes, Seller could introduce evidence of the negotiations about what would constitute a fair share of the winery's first-year profits to help explain the meaning of that term. This is because the term "fair share" is ambiguous and open to interpretation. Under the common law of contracts, when a term in a contract is ambiguous, the court will look to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intent and the meaning of the term. Extrinsic evidence includes evidence of the parties' negotiations, prior dealings, and trade usage. 

In this case, the term "fair share" is not defined in the contract and there is no agreement on the precise share of the first-year profits that Buyer must pay to Seller. Therefore, the court may look to extrinsic evidence to determine the parties' intent and the meaning of the term. The evidence of the parties' negotiations, in which Buyer said that 20% would be fair and Seller said that 25% would be fair, could be introduced to help explain the meaning of the term "fair share." This evidence could be used to argue that the parties intended for the "fair share" to be in the 20–25% range, and that Buyer's payment of only 5% of the first-year profits was not consistent with the parties' intent and the meaning of the term "fair share."

However, Buyer could argue that the written agreement is the final and complete expression of the parties' agreement and that extrinsic evidence should not be considered. This argument is based on the parol evidence rule, which generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to contradict or vary the terms of a written agreement. However, the parol evidence rule does not apply when the term in question is ambiguous and the extrinsic evidence is being used to explain the meaning of the term. Therefore, Seller could still introduce evidence of the negotiations about what would constitute a fair share of the winery's first-year profits to help explain the meaning of that term.
