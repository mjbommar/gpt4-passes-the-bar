The trust for the benefit of Donna was valid. Under the Uniform Trust Code, a trust is valid if it has a settlor, a trustee, a beneficiary, and a valid trust purpose. In this case, Arlene was the settlor, her friend was the trustee, Donna was the beneficiary, and the trust purpose was to pay for Donna's college education and give her the remaining assets when she reaches age 22. All of these elements were present, making the trust valid.

Additionally, the trust was properly created. Under the Uniform Trust Code, a trust is created when the settlor indicates an intention to create a trust, transfers property to the trust, and names a trustee. In this case, Arlene indicated her intention to create a trust when she gave her friend the package and instructed her to hold it as trustee for Donna. She also transferred property to the trust, specifically the necklace and bonds, and named her friend as the trustee. Therefore, the trust was properly created.

The fact that Arlene revoked the AD Trust does not affect the validity of the trust for Donna. The AD Trust was a separate trust with different beneficiaries and a different trust purpose. Arlene had the right to revoke the AD Trust because it did not contain a provision stating that it was irrevocable. Under the Uniform Trust Code, a trust is presumed to be revocable unless the trust instrument expressly states that it is irrevocable. Since the AD Trust did not contain such a provision, Arlene was within her rights to revoke it.

The trust for Donna also does not violate the Rule Against Perpetuities. The Rule Against Perpetuities prohibits a trust from lasting longer than 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the trust is created. In this case, the trust for Donna will terminate when she reaches age 22, which is well within the 21-year period. Therefore, the trust does not violate the Rule Against Perpetuities.

In conclusion, the trust for the benefit of Donna was valid because it had all the necessary elements, was properly created, was not affected by the revocation of the AD Trust, and did not violate the Rule Against Perpetuities.
