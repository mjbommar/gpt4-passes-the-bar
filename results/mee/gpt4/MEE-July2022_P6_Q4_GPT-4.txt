After February 1, 2021, the apartment building is owned by Wanda. This is because the original conveyance from Oscar to Frank included a condition subsequent, which stated that if at any time fewer than four apartments are being rented to below-median-income families, the apartment building automatically reverts to Oscar. This condition was triggered when Frank terminated the leases of all tenants in the building on February 1, 2021, resulting in no apartments being rented to below-median-income families. As a result, the apartment building automatically reverted to Oscar.

However, Oscar died in 2017, and the entire residue of his estate, including the apartment building, was given to Wanda in his will. Therefore, upon the triggering of the condition subsequent, the apartment building automatically reverted to Wanda as the beneficiary of Oscar's estate.

It is important to note that the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP) does not affect the ownership of the apartment building in this case. The USRAP generally prohibits the creation of future interests that may not vest within 21 years after the death of a measuring life. However, the condition subsequent in the original conveyance from Oscar to Frank was not a future interest, but rather a present interest subject to a condition. Therefore, the USRAP does not apply to this conveyance and does not affect the ownership of the apartment building.

In conclusion, after February 1, 2021, the apartment building is owned by Wanda as the beneficiary of Oscar's estate, due to the triggering of the condition subsequent in the original conveyance from Oscar to Frank.
