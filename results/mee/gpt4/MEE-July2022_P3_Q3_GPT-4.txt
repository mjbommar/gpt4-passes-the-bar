Yes, Brian has sufficient grounds to seek the judicial dissolution of the corporation under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA). The MBCA allows for judicial dissolution of a corporation in certain circumstances, including when the directors or those in control of the corporation are acting in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent. 

In this case, there are several actions taken by Danielle and the third director that could be considered oppressive or fraudulent. First, the decision to sell the parcel of land without discussing it with the other directors and without obtaining proper authorization from the board could be considered oppressive. Although Carol was authorized to negotiate financing agreements on behalf of the corporation, she was not authorized to sell the parcel of land. The fact that she signed a written agreement with the bank without discussing it with the other directors or obtaining proper authorization could be considered oppressive.

Second, the decision to distribute all of the sale proceeds to Danielle as a "bonus payment" could also be considered oppressive or fraudulent. The MBCA requires that dividends be distributed to shareholders in proportion to their ownership interests. In this case, Danielle owns 80% of the corporation's shares, while Brian owns 20%. Therefore, the decision to distribute all of the sale proceeds to Danielle, without any payment to Brian, could be considered oppressive or fraudulent.

Finally, the refusal to allow Brian to see the accounting records related to the purchase and sale of the parcel could also be considered oppressive. The MBCA requires that shareholders be allowed to inspect the corporation's books and records for a proper purpose. In this case, Brian has a proper purpose, as he is seeking to determine whether the sale of the parcel and the distribution of the sale proceeds were done in accordance with the law and the corporation's articles of incorporation and shareholders' agreement. The refusal to allow Brian to see the accounting records could be considered oppressive.

Based on these facts, Brian has sufficient grounds to seek the judicial dissolution of the corporation under the MBCA.
