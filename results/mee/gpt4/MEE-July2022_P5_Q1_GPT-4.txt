Yes, Developer is a person "required to be joined if feasible" to the Builder v. Lender action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a). Rule 19(a) provides that a person must be joined as a party to an action if (1) in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or (2) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.

In this case, Developer is a required party under both prongs of Rule 19(a). First, Developer is a required party because the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties in its absence. The dispute between Builder and Lender arises out of the loan agreement between Developer and Lender, and Developer is a party to that agreement. Without Developer as a party, the court cannot fully adjudicate the rights and obligations of the parties under the loan agreement. For example, if the court were to find that Lender breached the loan agreement by withholding the final payment, it would need to determine the amount of damages owed to Developer, as well as the amount of damages owed to Builder as a third-party beneficiary. This would be difficult, if not impossible, to do without Developer as a party to the action.

Second, Developer is a required party because it has an interest in the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in its absence may impair or impede its ability to protect that interest. Developer has an interest in the loan agreement with Lender, as well as an interest in the construction contract with Builder. If the court were to find that Lender breached the loan agreement, Developer would have an interest in recovering damages from Lender. Similarly, if the court were to find that Builder is entitled to payment from Lender as a third-party beneficiary, Developer would have an interest in ensuring that it is not held liable for any amounts owed to Builder. Without Developer as a party, there is a risk that it will be unable to protect these interests.

Finally, Developer is a required party because its absence may leave Lender subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations. If the court were to find that Lender breached the loan agreement and owes damages to Builder, Lender could potentially be subject to a separate action by Developer for breach of the same agreement. This could result in Lender being held liable for the same damages twice, or being subject to inconsistent obligations.

In conclusion, Developer is a person "required to be joined if feasible" to the Builder v. Lender action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a) because the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties in its absence, Developer has an interest in the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in its absence may impair or impede its ability to protect that interest, and Developer's absence may leave Lender subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations.
