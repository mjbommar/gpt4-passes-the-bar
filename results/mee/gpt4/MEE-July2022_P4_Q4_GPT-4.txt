The bank account should be distributed to Arlene's nieces and nephew per stirpes. Under the statute in the jurisdiction, if a decedent died intestate without a surviving spouse, issue, or parent, the decedent's property is distributed to the issue of his or her parents per stirpes. In this case, Arlene died without a surviving spouse, issue, or parent. Therefore, the property should be distributed to the issue of her parents, which are her nieces and nephew.

Under the per stirpes distribution, each branch of the family receives an equal share of the estate. In this case, there are two branches of the family: one branch consisting of Arlene's three nieces (the children of her deceased sister) and one branch consisting of her nephew (the child of her deceased older brother). Therefore, each branch should receive one-half of the estate, or $150,000. The three nieces should each receive one-third of their branch's share, or $50,000 each, and the nephew should receive the entire share of his branch, or $150,000.

It is important to note that the testamentary trust to Political Party is invalid because it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. The Rule Against Perpetuities provides that no interest in property is valid unless it must vest, if at all, within a life in being at the creation of the interest plus 21 years. In this case, the testamentary trust directs that the income from the trust be paid to the Political Party annually and not to any other person. This creates a perpetual trust, which is not allowed under the Rule Against Perpetuities. Therefore, the testamentary trust is invalid and the property in the trust should be distributed according to the statute.
