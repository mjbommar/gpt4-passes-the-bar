The testamentary trust for the benefit of the Political Party is likely valid. Under the Uniform Trust Code, a trust may be created for a charitable purpose, which includes "the advancement of religion, education, or science; the relief of poverty; the promotion of health; governmental or municipal purposes; or other purposes the achievement of which is beneficial to the community" (UTC § 405(a)). The Political Party's mission to support candidates for public office who accept its political views may be considered a charitable purpose under the promotion of governmental or municipal purposes.

However, the trust may be subject to the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, which provides that no interest in property is valid unless it must vest, if at all, within 21 years after the death of some life in being at the creation of the interest. The testamentary trust for the benefit of the Political Party is a perpetual trust, meaning that it is intended to last indefinitely. Therefore, it may violate the Rule Against Perpetuities and be deemed invalid.

However, many jurisdictions have adopted the "cy pres" doctrine, which allows a court to modify a charitable trust to carry out the settlor's general charitable intent when the specific charitable purpose becomes impossible or impracticable to achieve. If the court determines that the Political Party's mission is a valid charitable purpose, but that the perpetual nature of the trust violates the Rule Against Perpetuities, it may modify the trust to carry out Arlene's general charitable intent in a way that complies with the Rule Against Perpetuities.

In conclusion, the testamentary trust for the benefit of the Political Party is likely valid as a charitable trust under the Uniform Trust Code. However, it may be subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities and may need to be modified by the court under the "cy pres" doctrine to comply with the rule.
