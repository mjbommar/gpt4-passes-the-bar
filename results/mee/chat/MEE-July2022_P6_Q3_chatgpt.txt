Upon Oscar's death, Wanda has no interest in the apartment building. Oscar conveyed the apartment building to his grandson Frank and his heirs so long as at least four apartments in the apartment building are rented to families with incomes below the state median income for a family of their size. If at any time fewer than four apartments are being rented to below-median-income families, the apartment building automatically reverts to Oscar. This conveyance is valid and enforceable because it satisfies the requirements of the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities.

The conveyance to Frank and his heirs is a fee simple determinable with a possibility of reverter. A fee simple determinable is a present possessory estate that automatically ends when a specified event occurs, which is the failure to rent at least four apartments to below-median-income families. The possibility of reverter is a future interest in the grantor that automatically becomes possessory upon the occurrence of the specified event. In this case, the specified event occurred on February 1, 2021, when Frank terminated the leases of all tenants in the building to begin his plan to convert all the apartments in the building to luxury apartments. As a result, beginning February 1, 2021, no apartments in the building were being rented to below-median-income families, and the apartment building automatically reverted to Oscar.

Wanda's interest in the family home is valid. Oscar gave the family home to Wanda for life, and upon her death to his daughter Adele and her heirs. This conveyance is a life estate with a remainder interest. A life estate is an estate in land that lasts for the lifetime of a specified person, in this case, Wanda. The remainder interest is a future interest in a third party that becomes possessory upon the termination of the life estate. Adele's remainder interest is valid because it is a vested remainder in fee simple absolute, which means that it is certain to become possessory in the future and is not subject to any conditions.

Upon Adele's death, Frank inherited her entire estate, including her remainder interest in the family home. Frank is now the owner of the remainder interest, which will become possessory upon the termination of Wanda's life estate.

Frank's refusal to pay the property taxes on the family home is not valid. As the owner of the remainder interest, Frank has a duty to maintain the property and pay its expenses, including property taxes. Adele's past payment of the property taxes does not relieve Frank of his duty to pay them. If Frank fails to pay the property taxes, Wanda may seek a court order requiring him to do so or may seek to sell the property to pay the taxes.

Wanda's claim that she now owns the apartment building is not valid. The apartment building reverted to Oscar on February 1, 2021, when Frank terminated the leases of all tenants in the building to begin his plan to convert all the apartments in the building to luxury apartments. As a result, beginning February 1, 2021, no apartments in the building were being rented to below-median-income families, and the apartment building automatically reverted to Oscar. Wanda has no interest in the apartment building because it has already reverted to Oscar.
