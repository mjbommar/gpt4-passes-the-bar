The issue presented is whether Wanda or Frank is obligated to pay the property taxes on the family home. 

Under Oscar's will, the family home was given to Wanda for life, and upon her death, to Adele and her heirs. Thus, Wanda has a life estate in the family home, and Adele had a remainder interest in the property. Upon Adele's death, her entire estate passed to Frank. 

Generally, a life tenant is responsible for paying all taxes and expenses associated with the property during the term of their life estate. However, in this case, it appears that Adele had been paying the property taxes on the family home before her death. It is unclear whether Adele was paying the taxes as a gift or whether there was an agreement between Adele and Wanda regarding the payment of taxes. 

If there was an agreement between Adele and Wanda regarding the payment of taxes, then Wanda may be responsible for paying the property taxes. However, if there was no such agreement, then Wanda, as the life tenant, would be responsible for paying the property taxes on the family home. Therefore, Wanda is obligated to pay the property taxes on the family home unless there was an agreement between her and Adele stating otherwise. 

As for Frank's argument that he is not responsible for paying the property taxes, his argument is not persuasive. Frank inherited the family home from Adele and therefore has a vested interest in the property. As such, he is obligated to pay his share of the property taxes. If Wanda is unable to pay the entire amount, then Frank may be responsible for paying a portion of the taxes. 

In regards to the apartment building, Oscar conveyed the property to Frank and his heirs with the condition that at least four apartments in the building must be rented to families with incomes below the state median income for a family of their size. If at any time fewer than four apartments are being rented to below-median-income families, the apartment building automatically reverts to Oscar. 

Until February 1, 2021, Frank had leased four apartments in the building to below-median-income families. On that date, he validly and lawfully terminated the leases of all tenants in the building to begin his plan to convert all the apartments in the building to luxury apartments. As a result, beginning February 1, 2021, no apartments in the building were being rented to below-median-income families. 

Under the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, a future interest in property is invalid if it may vest more than 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. Here, Oscar's conveyance of the apartment building to Frank and his heirs is subject to the rule against perpetuities. 

The condition that at least four apartments in the building must be rented to below-median-income families is a condition subsequent. If the condition is not met, then the property reverts back to Oscar. However, the condition is not enforceable because it violates the rule against perpetuities. The condition could potentially vest more than 21 years after the death of a life in being at the time the interest was created. 

Therefore, Frank is the owner of the apartment building and is free to do with the property as he sees fit, including converting all the apartments to luxury apartments. Wanda does not own the apartment building.
