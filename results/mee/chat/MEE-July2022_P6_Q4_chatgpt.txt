The ownership of the apartment building after February 1, 2021, is a complex issue involving the application of the Rule Against Perpetuities and the terms of Oscar's conveyance.

The Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities provides that no interest is valid unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. In this case, the life in being at the creation of the interest was Oscar, who died in 2017. Therefore, any interest created by Oscar's conveyance must vest, if at all, by 2038, which is 21 years after Oscar's death.

Oscar's conveyance of the apartment building to Frank and his heirs is subject to a condition subsequent. A condition subsequent is a provision in a conveyance that provides for the automatic termination of the interest if a specified event occurs. In this case, the specified event is the failure to rent at least four apartments to below-median-income families. If this event occurs, the apartment building automatically reverts to Oscar.

On February 1, 2021, Frank terminated the leases of all tenants in the building, and as a result, no apartments in the building were being rented to below-median-income families. Therefore, the condition subsequent was triggered, and the apartment building automatically reverted to Oscar.

However, Oscar died in 2017, and his will provided that the family home was to be given to Wanda for life, and upon her death, to Adele and her heirs. The will also provided that the entire residue of Oscar's estate was to be given to Wanda. Therefore, upon Oscar's death, the family home passed to Wanda for life, and upon her death, to Adele and her heirs.

Adele died in 2020, and her will provided that her entire estate was to be given to Frank. Therefore, Frank is the current owner of Adele's share of the family home.

Wanda cannot afford to pay the property tax on the family home, and Frank has suggested that she rent it out to generate income. However, Wanda has a life estate in the family home, which means that she has the right to possess and use the property during her lifetime. She cannot be forced to rent it out against her will.

In conclusion, after February 1, 2021, the apartment building reverted to Oscar's estate due to the triggering of the condition subsequent in Oscar's conveyance. However, Oscar's estate is subject to the terms of his will, which provide that the family home is to be given to Wanda for life, and upon her death, to Adele and her heirs. Adele's share of the family home passed to Frank upon her death. Wanda cannot be forced to rent out the family home, as she has a life estate in the property.
