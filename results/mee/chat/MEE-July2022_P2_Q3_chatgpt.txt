One potential legal issue in this dispute is whether Seller breached her obligations under the purchase agreement by opening and operating a new winery. 

Under common law, a contract is a legally binding agreement between parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. In this case, Buyer and Seller entered into a written agreement for the sale of Seller's winery, which included a provision prohibiting Seller from owning or operating a winery anywhere in the United States for 10 years after the closing. 

Assuming that Buyer is not in breach of any of his obligations under the purchase agreement, Seller's opening and operating a new winery may be a breach of her obligations under the agreement. Specifically, Seller agreed not to own or operate a winery anywhere in the United States for 10 years after the closing, and opening a new winery would likely be considered a violation of that provision. 

However, there may be arguments that Seller's new winery is not in violation of the agreement. For example, Seller may argue that the provision only applies to wineries that are similar to the one she sold to Buyer, and that her new winery is different enough that it does not violate the agreement. Alternatively, Seller may argue that the provision is overly broad and violates public policy, and therefore should not be enforced. 

Ultimately, whether Seller's opening of a new winery constitutes a breach of her obligations under the purchase agreement will depend on the specific language of the agreement and the interpretation of that language by the court. If the court finds that Seller did breach the agreement, Buyer may be entitled to damages or other remedies for that breach.
