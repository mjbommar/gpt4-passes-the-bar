The distribution of Arlene's bank account will depend on whether the Declaration of Trust for the AD Trust was revocable or irrevocable. If the trust was revocable, then Arlene's revocation of the trust effectively terminated it and the assets listed in Schedule A would have reverted back to her personal ownership. In that case, the bank account would be part of Arlene's probate estate and would be distributed according to the laws of intestacy since Arlene did not leave a valid will disposing of all her property.

Under the statute in this jurisdiction, if a decedent died intestate without a surviving spouse, issue, or parent, the decedent's property is distributed to the issue of his or her parents per stirpes. In this case, Arlene's parents are not mentioned, but it is clear that she had siblings who have children. Therefore, her estate would be distributed equally among her surviving nieces and nephew, Carla, Donna, Edna, and Fred, with each receiving one-fourth of the estate.

However, if the AD Trust was irrevocable, then the assets listed in Schedule A would have been held in trust for the benefit of Arlene's nieces, Carla, Donna, and Edna, upon her death. The bank account would not be part of the trust since it was never transferred to it. Therefore, the bank account would be part of Arlene's probate estate and would be distributed according to the laws of intestacy as described above.

As for the validity of the testamentary trust to the Political Party, it is unclear from the facts whether it is valid or not. The trust directs that all of Arlene's worldly goods not otherwise validly disposed of during her life be left in trust for the Political Party, and that the trustee pay all income from the trust annually to the Political Party and not to any other person. This raises the question of whether the trust violates the Rule Against Perpetuities.

The Rule Against Perpetuities provides that no interest in property is valid unless it vests, if at all, within 21 years after the death of some life in being at the time of the creation of the interest. In this case, the trust is perpetual since it does not specify a termination date or any measuring lives that would limit its duration. Therefore, if the trust violates the Rule Against Perpetuities, it would be void and the assets would pass according to Arlene's will or the laws of intestacy, depending on the validity of the AD Trust.

Assuming that the trust to the Political Party is invalid, the assets not disposed of during Arlene's life would be distributed according to her will. However, it is unclear from the facts whether Arlene's will disposes of all her property. If it does not, then the remaining assets would be distributed according to the laws of intestacy as described above.
