The issue presented is whether the corporation is bound by the land-sale agreement signed by Carol on behalf of the corporation without the approval of the board of directors. 

Under the MBCA, a corporation's power to act is vested in its board of directors, and any act outside the scope of the board's authority is void unless ratified by the corporation. In this case, the articles of incorporation state that the corporation's purpose is to pursue property development opportunities and any other lawful business. The board of directors, with unanimous approval, purchased a parcel of land for the purpose of developing it into residential lots and constructing homes on each lot. Therefore, the purchase of the parcel of land falls within the scope of the corporation's authority.

However, the sale of the parcel of land to the bank for $6 million was not approved by the board of directors. Carol, a consultant hired by the board, signed the agreement without discussing it with any of the corporation's directors. Carol did not have the authority to bind the corporation to the terms of the sale agreement without prior approval from the board of directors.

The fact that Danielle later agreed with Carol that the deal was in the corporation's best interest does not validate the sale agreement. The board of directors is responsible for making decisions on behalf of the corporation, and any action taken outside the board's authority is void unless ratified by the corporation. 

Therefore, the corporation is not bound by the land-sale agreement signed by Carol. The board of directors did not approve the sale agreement, and Carol did not have the authority to bind the corporation to the terms of the agreement without prior approval from the board of directors.

In addition, the board's decision to distribute all the sale proceeds to Danielle as a "bonus payment" is questionable. The board has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of the corporation and its shareholders. The decision to distribute all the sale proceeds to Danielle as a bonus payment may be a breach of that duty, especially since Brian did not receive any payment from the sale. Brian's request to see all accounting records related to the purchase and sale of the parcel should have been granted, and the board's refusal to do so may also be a breach of their fiduciary duty.

In conclusion, the corporation is not bound by the land-sale agreement signed by Carol, and the board's decision to distribute all the sale proceeds to Danielle may be a breach of their fiduciary duty. Brian's request to see all accounting records related to the purchase and sale of the parcel should have been granted, and the board's refusal to do so may also be a breach of their fiduciary duty.
