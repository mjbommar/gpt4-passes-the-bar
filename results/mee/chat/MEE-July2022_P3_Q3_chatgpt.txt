Brian may have sufficient grounds to seek the judicial dissolution of the corporation. Under the MBCA, a court may dissolve a corporation if it is established that the directors or those in control of the corporation have acted in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent. 

Here, several actions by the board of directors may give rise to a claim for judicial dissolution. First, Carol's unilateral decision to sell the parcel without consulting with the board of directors may be considered illegal or fraudulent. As a consultant, Carol had no authority to sell the corporation's property without proper authorization from the board. By signing the agreement with the bank, Carol may have breached her fiduciary duty to the corporation and its shareholders. 

Second, the board's decision to distribute all the sale proceeds to Danielle as a "bonus payment" may be considered oppressive. Under the MBCA, a court may dissolve a corporation if the directors or those in control of the corporation have acted in a manner that is oppressive to minority shareholders. Here, Brian, as a minority shareholder, did not receive any payment from the sale of the parcel and was denied access to accounting records related to the transaction. The board's decision to distribute all the proceeds to Danielle may be deemed oppressive to Brian's interests as a shareholder. 

Third, the board's refusal to provide Brian with access to accounting records related to the purchase and sale of the parcel may also be considered oppressive. Under the MBCA, shareholders have the right to inspect and copy accounting records of the corporation. By denying Brian's request, the board may have violated his statutory rights as a shareholder. 

In addition, the board's decision to sell the parcel may also be subject to scrutiny under the business judgment rule. Under this rule, courts generally defer to the decisions of corporate directors as long as they act in good faith, with due care, and in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. Here, the board's decision to sell the parcel may be questioned given the fact that the corporation had just purchased the land for $5 million and had plans to develop it for residential use. The board's decision to sell the land for $6 million to the first bank that declined to provide financing may be seen as a breach of their duty of loyalty and care to the corporation and its shareholders. 

In conclusion, Brian may have sufficient grounds to seek the judicial dissolution of the corporation based on the board's actions in selling the parcel, distributing the proceeds, and denying him access to accounting records. The court would need to consider the specific facts and legal principles involved in this case to determine whether dissolution is warranted.
