Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19(a), a person is required to be joined as a party if feasible if "in that person's absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties" or "that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person's absence may: (i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person's ability to protect the interest; or (ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest." 

In the present case, Developer is a required party to the Builder v. Lender action under Rule 19(a). First, Developer is a party to the underlying construction contract with Builder, and any relief granted to Builder against Lender may not be complete without Developer's participation. Specifically, if Builder is successful in obtaining a judgment against Lender for the $100,000 final disbursement, Developer may still be liable to Builder for any remaining unpaid amounts under the construction contract. Therefore, Developer's absence from the action may impair or impede its ability to protect its interest in avoiding double or inconsistent obligations.

Second, Developer's interest in the subject matter of the action is clear. Builder's claim against Lender is based on the loan agreement between Lender and Developer, and Builder alleges that it is a third-party beneficiary entitled to payment from Lender. Developer's absence from the action may leave Lender subject to a substantial risk of incurring double or inconsistent obligations because of Developer's potential liability to Builder under the construction contract.

Furthermore, it is feasible to join Developer as a party to the action. Developer is a limited liability company organized in State A, with its principal place of business in State A, and is subject to personal jurisdiction in the federal district court in State A. Therefore, the court can order Developer to be joined as a party to the action without violating any jurisdictional or venue requirements.

In conclusion, Developer is a person required to be joined as a party to the Builder v. Lender action under Rule 19(a). Developer's absence from the action may impair or impede its ability to protect its interest and may leave Lender subject to a substantial risk of incurring double or inconsistent obligations. It is feasible to join Developer as a party to the action, and the court should order Developer to be joined to ensure complete and consistent resolution of the dispute.
