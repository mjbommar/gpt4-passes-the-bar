The bonus payment made to Danielle, which was approved by a majority of the board of directors, was not proper.

Under the Model Business Corporation Act (MBCA), directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. This duty includes the duty of loyalty, which requires directors to act in good faith and in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders, and the duty of care, which requires directors to exercise reasonable care and diligence in their decision-making.

In this case, the board of directors approved the sale of the parcel of land to the bank for $6 million, which was initially negotiated and signed by Carol, a consultant hired by Danielle. Although Danielle later called a special meeting of the board to approve the sale, Carol's actions in negotiating and signing the sale agreement without the knowledge or consent of the board violated the board's duty of care. The board should have been involved in the negotiation and approval of the sale agreement, and Carol's actions deprived the board of the opportunity to exercise its duty of care.

Furthermore, the board's decision to distribute all the sale proceeds to Danielle as a "bonus payment" violated the board's duty of loyalty. The board's decision to distribute the proceeds to Danielle, who owned 80% of the corporation's shares, to the exclusion of Brian, who owned 20% of the shares, was not in the best interests of the corporation and its shareholders. The board's decision to distribute the proceeds as a bonus payment also suggests that the payment was not based on a legitimate business purpose, but rather was intended to benefit Danielle at the expense of the corporation and its shareholders.

Finally, the board's refusal to provide Brian with accounting records related to the purchase and sale of the parcel of land violated Brian's right to access corporate records under the MBCA. Shareholders have the right to inspect and copy corporate records, including financial statements and minutes of board meetings, for a proper purpose, and Brian's request to see the accounting records related to the purchase and sale of the parcel of land was a proper purpose. The board's refusal to provide Brian with the records suggests that the board was attempting to conceal its actions from Brian and deprive him of his rights as a shareholder.

In conclusion, the bonus payment made to Danielle and the board's refusal to provide Brian with accounting records were both improper and violated the board's fiduciary duties under the MBCA.
