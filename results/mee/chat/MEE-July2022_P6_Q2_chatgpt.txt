Upon conveying the apartment building to Frank, Oscar retained a possibility of reverter in the property. This interest was valid because it is a recognized interest under the law of property. The possibility of reverter is a future interest that arises in a grantor when he transfers a determinable fee estate and retains the right to reacquire the property if certain conditions occur. In this case, Oscar conveyed the apartment building to Frank and his heirs so long as at least four apartments in the apartment building are rented to families with incomes below the state median income for a family of their size. If at any time fewer than four apartments are being rented to below-median-income families, the apartment building automatically reverts to Oscar. This means that Oscar retained the possibility of reverter in the property, which is a valid future interest.

The conveyance to Frank and his heirs is a determinable fee estate because it is subject to a condition that will automatically terminate the estate if it is not fulfilled. The condition is that at least four apartments in the apartment building are rented to families with incomes below the state median income for a family of their size. If this condition is not met, the estate automatically reverts to Oscar. This means that Frank and his heirs hold a determinable fee estate in the property, subject to the possibility of reverter held by Oscar.

Under the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, a future interest is invalid if there is any possibility that it may vest more than 21 years after the death of a measuring life. In this case, the measuring life is Oscar, who died in 2017. The condition in the conveyance to Frank and his heirs will either be fulfilled or terminated within a reasonable time after Oscar's death. Therefore, the possibility of reverter held by Oscar is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities and is a valid future interest.

In conclusion, upon conveying the apartment building to Frank, Oscar retained a possibility of reverter in the property, which is a valid future interest. Frank and his heirs hold a determinable fee estate in the property, subject to the possibility of reverter held by Oscar. The possibility of reverter is not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities and is a valid future interest.
