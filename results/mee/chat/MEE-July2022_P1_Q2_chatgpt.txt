The trial court should deny the defendant's motion to exclude the photograph of Defendant's tattoo and the former gang leader's anticipated testimony about it as inadmissible character evidence. 

Under Rule 404(a) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, evidence of a person's character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait. However, Rule 404(b) provides that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admissible for other purposes, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident. 

Here, the prosecution is not seeking to introduce evidence of Defendant's character or character trait to prove that he acted in accordance with that trait in shooting Victim. Rather, the prosecution seeks to introduce evidence of Defendant's gang membership and specifically, his membership in The Lions, to prove his motive and intent in shooting Victim. The prosecution's theory is that the shooting was the result of a gang dispute, and evidence of Defendant's gang membership is relevant to proving that theory. 

The anticipated testimony of the former gang leader about Defendant's tattoo is also admissible under Rule 701 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 701 allows a lay witness to testify in the form of an opinion if the witness's opinion is based on the witness's perception and is helpful to a clear understanding of the witness's testimony or to the determination of a fact in issue. Here, the former gang leader's opinion about Defendant's tattoo is based on his personal knowledge and experience as a former leader of The Lions, and his testimony is helpful to the jury in understanding the significance of Defendant's tattoo and its connection to The Lions. 

Furthermore, the anticipated testimony of the City detective about gang identification, gang organizational structure, and gang activities generally is admissible under Rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Rule 702 allows expert testimony if the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, and if the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. Here, the City detective has extensive experience and training in investigating gangs and their activities, and his testimony will assist the jury in understanding the nature of gangs, their organizational structure, and their activities, as well as the specific characteristics of The Lions gang. 

In sum, the trial court should deny the defendant's motion to exclude the photograph of Defendant's tattoo and the former gang leader's anticipated testimony about it, as well as the anticipated testimony of the City detective about gangs and gang activities generally. These pieces of evidence are relevant to proving the prosecution's theory of the case and are admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence.
