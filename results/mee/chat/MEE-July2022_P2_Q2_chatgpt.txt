Seller could introduce evidence of the negotiations about what would constitute a fair share of the winery's first-year profits to help explain the meaning of that term. The parol evidence rule generally prohibits the introduction of extrinsic evidence to vary or contradict the terms of a fully integrated written contract. However, evidence of prior or contemporaneous negotiations or agreements may be admissible to explain or supplement the terms of a written contract if the contract is ambiguous or incomplete. Here, the written agreement between Buyer and Seller did not specify the precise share of the first-year profits that Buyer must pay to Seller. The agreement merely stated that Buyer would pay a "fair share" of the profits. This term is ambiguous because it could reasonably be interpreted to mean different percentages by different parties. Therefore, Seller could introduce evidence of the negotiations about what would constitute a fair share of the winery's first-year profits to help explain the meaning of that term.

The parol evidence rule does not apply to evidence of subsequent agreements or modifications of the written contract. Here, Seller and Buyer had an oral agreement that if Seller sold the winery to Buyer, he would continue to use the label for as long as he sold red wines. This oral agreement was made during the negotiations and was not included in the written agreement. Therefore, Seller could introduce evidence of this oral agreement to show that Buyer breached the agreement by discontinuing the use of the label with Seller's picture.

Moreover, the written agreement did not contain an integration or merger clause. An integration or merger clause is a provision in a written contract that states that the written contract is the final and complete expression of the parties' agreement and that all prior or contemporaneous negotiations or agreements are merged into the written contract. The absence of an integration or merger clause indicates that the parties did not intend the written agreement to be the complete and final expression of their agreement. Therefore, extrinsic evidence may be admissible to supplement or explain the written agreement.

In conclusion, Seller could introduce evidence of the negotiations about what would constitute a fair share of the winery's first-year profits to help explain the meaning of that term. Seller could also introduce evidence of the oral agreement between her and Buyer regarding the use of the label with Seller's picture. The absence of an integration or merger clause in the written agreement indicates that extrinsic evidence may be admissible to supplement or explain the written agreement.
