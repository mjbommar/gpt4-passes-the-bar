The court should deny Lender's motion to dismiss. 

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19, a party is considered "required" if their absence would (1) impair their ability to protect their interest, or (2) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of that interest. If a required party cannot be joined, the court must determine whether the action should proceed without them or be dismissed. 

Here, Developer is a necessary party because it has an interest in the outcome of the case. Builder's claim is based on Lender's alleged breach of the loan agreement with Developer, and Developer is a party to that agreement. Developer's absence could impair its ability to protect its interest in the loan agreement and in the final payment to Builder. Additionally, if Builder were to recover the $100,000 from Lender without Developer being a party to the action, Developer may be subject to a substantial risk of incurring double or inconsistent obligations regarding the loan balance and final payment to Builder. 

However, the court should still deny Lender's motion to dismiss because Developer cannot be joined. Rule 19(a)(1) requires joinder of a required party if feasible. But here, Developer cannot be joined because it is a limited liability company with only two members, one of whom is a domiciliary of a different state than Builder and Lender. Under Rule 19(b), if a required party cannot be joined, the court must determine whether the action should proceed without them or be dismissed. 

In making this determination, the court should consider several factors, including: (1) the extent to which a judgment rendered in the person's absence might prejudice that person or the existing parties; (2) the extent to which any prejudice could be lessened or avoided by protective provisions in the judgment, shaping the relief, or other measures; (3) whether a judgment rendered in the person's absence would be adequate; and (4) whether the plaintiff would have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed. 

Here, the court should find that the action should proceed without Developer. First, Developer is not prejudiced by its absence because it is a party to the loan agreement and can protect its interest in that agreement in a separate action if necessary. Second, any potential prejudice can be lessened by protective provisions in the judgment or shaping the relief. For example, the court could order that any recovery by Builder be applied to Developer's loan balance. Third, a judgment rendered in Developer's absence would still be adequate because Builder's claim is based on Lender's alleged breach of the loan agreement, not any direct claim against Developer. Finally, Builder would not have an adequate remedy if the action were dismissed because it has a valid claim against Lender for the final payment. 

Therefore, the court should deny Lender's motion to dismiss and allow the action to proceed without Developer.
