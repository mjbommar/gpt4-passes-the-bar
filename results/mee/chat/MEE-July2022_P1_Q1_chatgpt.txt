The trial court should deny the defendant's motion to exclude the detective's anticipated testimony about gang identification, organization, and activities as improper expert testimony. 

Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, expert testimony is admissible if it is (1) based on sufficient facts or data, (2) the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the expert has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case. The trial court has broad discretion in determining the admissibility of expert testimony, and its decision will only be overturned if it is an abuse of discretion.

In this case, the detective's anticipated testimony satisfies all three prongs of the Rule 702 test. First, the detective's testimony is based on his extensive experience investigating gangs and criminal activity in City, as well as his training and education on gang structure, membership, and activities. He has also interviewed, investigated, and identified gang members in his prior role as a corrections officer. Therefore, the detective has sufficient facts and data to support his testimony.

Second, the detective's testimony is based on reliable principles and methods. He has attended numerous training sessions on gang structure, membership, and activities, and has frequently been asked to lead such sessions. His experience and knowledge in this area make him qualified to testify as an expert on gang identification, organization, and activities. Additionally, his testimony is consistent with the general understanding of gangs and their activities.

Finally, the detective has reliably applied his principles and methods to the facts of the case. He has identified Defendant as a member of The Lions based on his tattoo, which contains symbols unique to the gang. He has also provided general information about gang behavior and activities that is relevant to the prosecution's theory of the case. Therefore, the detective's anticipated testimony is admissible under Rule 702.

The defendant may argue that the detective's testimony is prejudicial, and that its probative value is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 403, relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. However, the detective's testimony is highly probative of Defendant's alleged gang membership and the prosecution's theory of the case. Any potential prejudice can be mitigated by the trial court through limiting instructions to the jury.

In conclusion, the trial court should deny the defendant's motion to exclude the detective's anticipated testimony about gang identification, organization, and activities as improper expert testimony. The detective's testimony satisfies the requirements of Rule 702 and is highly probative of Defendant's alleged gang membership and the prosecution's theory of the case.
