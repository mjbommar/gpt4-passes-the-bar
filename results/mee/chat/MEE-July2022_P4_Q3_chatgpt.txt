The validity of the testamentary trust for the benefit of the Political Party depends on whether it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities. 

The Rule Against Perpetuities provides that no interest in property is valid unless it must vest, if at all, not later than 21 years after some life in being at the creation of the interest. In other words, a trust must terminate within a life in being plus 21 years. 

In this case, the trust for the benefit of the Political Party is a perpetual trust, meaning it has no termination date. The trust directs that all of Arlene's worldly goods not otherwise validly disposed of during her life be left in trust for the Political Party, and that the trustee pay all income from the trust annually to the Political Party and not to any other person. 

Since the trust has no termination date, it violates the Rule Against Perpetuities and is therefore invalid. The trust would need to terminate within a life in being plus 21 years to be valid. 

Therefore, the assets that were intended to be left to the Political Party would be distributed according to Arlene's will or, if she died intestate with no surviving spouse, issue, or parent, to her siblings' children per stirpes. 

It should be noted that the validity of the Arlene Doe Trust is not relevant to the validity of the testamentary trust for the benefit of the Political Party. The AD Trust was revoked by Arlene two years ago, and the assets that were intended to be transferred to the AD Trust were given to Arlene's friend as trustee for Donna. The validity of the AD Trust is therefore moot.
