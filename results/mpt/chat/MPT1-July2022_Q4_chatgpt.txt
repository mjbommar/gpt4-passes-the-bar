Re: Walter Hixon matter

Based on the relevant statutes and case law, I recommend that we advise Mr. Hixon to file for an annulment in the State of Columbia and a divorce in the State of Franklin.

Under Columbia law, a marriage is voidable if one spouse was married to another person at the time of the subsequent marriage and that spouse was absent and not known to the party commencing the proceeding to be living for a period of five successive years immediately preceding the subsequent marriage for which the annulment decree is sought. In this case, Mr. Hixon was married to Ms. Prescott at the time of his marriage to Ms. Tucker, and he believed that Ms. Prescott was dead. However, since Ms. Prescott is still alive, Mr. Hixon's marriage to Ms. Tucker is voidable under Columbia law.

On the other hand, under Franklin law, a marriage is void if either party is lawfully married to another person. Since Mr. Hixon's marriage to Ms. Prescott was valid, his marriage to Ms. Tucker is void under Franklin law.

In terms of jurisdiction, the Restatement advises that a court determine the applicable law based on the state with the most significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage, using factors such as relevant policies, protection of justified expectations, certainty and predictability, and ease of determination and application of the law. In this case, Mr. Hixon and Ms. Tucker purchased property together in Columbia, and Mr. Hixon's marriage to Ms. Tucker was also contracted in Columbia. However, Mr. Hixon has since moved to Franklin, and his relationship with Ms. Tucker has deteriorated. Additionally, his marriage to Ms. Prescott was contracted in Columbia. 

Given these facts, it seems that both states have significant relationships to the marriage and the parties involved. However, since Mr. Hixon's marriage to Ms. Tucker is void under Franklin law, it would be appropriate to file for divorce in Franklin. As for the voidable marriage to Ms. Tucker, Mr. Hixon should file for an annulment in Columbia, where the marriage was contracted, and where he and Ms. Tucker purchased property together.

In conclusion, I recommend that we advise Mr. Hixon to file for an annulment in Columbia and a divorce in Franklin. This will allow him to address both marriages and the issue of the shared property in an appropriate and efficient manner.
