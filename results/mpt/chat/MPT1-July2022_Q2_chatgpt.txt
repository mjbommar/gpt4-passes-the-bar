Re: Walter Hixon matter

Issue Presented
Must Mr. Hixon file a lawsuit to annul his second marriage, and if yes, would he be able to obtain an annulment under the applicable law?

Short Answer
Yes, Mr. Hixon must file a lawsuit to annul his second marriage in the State of Columbia, and he may be able to obtain an annulment under the applicable law based on the fact that he was still legally married to Ms. Prescott at the time of his marriage to Ms. Tucker.

Discussion
Under Columbia Revised Statutes ยง 718.02, a marriage is voidable if the spouse of either party was living and the marriage with that spouse was then in force and that spouse was absent and not known to the party commencing the proceeding to be living for a period of five successive years immediately preceding the subsequent marriage for which the annulment decree is sought. Here, Mr. Hixon was still legally married to Ms. Prescott at the time of his marriage to Ms. Tucker, and he did not know that Ms. Prescott was still alive. Therefore, he may be able to obtain an annulment of his second marriage to Ms. Tucker based on the fact that it was voidable under Columbia law.

However, Mr. Hixon must file a lawsuit to obtain an annulment of his second marriage in the State of Columbia. An annulment is a judicial decree declaring that a marriage is void, and it must be obtained through a legal proceeding. Mr. Hixon cannot simply declare his second marriage void on his own.

In addition, it is important to note that the Franklin court would likely recognize the Columbia annulment decree under the principles of full faith and credit. The Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 283 provides that a marriage that satisfies the requirements of the state where the marriage was contracted will be recognized as valid everywhere unless it violates the strong public policy of another state which had the most significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage at the time of the marriage. Here, the State of Columbia had the most significant relationship to Mr. Hixon's second marriage, as it was where the marriage was contracted and where the parties resided at the time of the marriage. Therefore, if Mr. Hixon is able to obtain an annulment of his second marriage in the State of Columbia, the Franklin court would likely recognize the annulment decree.

Conclusion
Mr. Hixon must file a lawsuit to obtain an annulment of his second marriage in the State of Columbia, and he may be able to obtain an annulment based on the fact that he was still legally married to Ms. Prescott at the time of his marriage to Ms. Tucker. If he is able to obtain an annulment in Columbia, the Franklin court would likely recognize the annulment decree.
