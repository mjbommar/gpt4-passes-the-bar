Re: Walter Hixon matter

I have analyzed the question of whether we should advise Mr. Hixon to file in Columbia or in Franklin. Based on my analysis, I recommend that Mr. Hixon file in Columbia. I will explain my reasoning below.

1. Filing in Columbia

There are several reasons why filing in Columbia would be the better option for Mr. Hixon. First, Columbia has the most significant relationship to the parties and the marriage. Both of Mr. Hixon's marriages were contracted in Columbia, and he and Ms. Tucker lived together and purchased property in Columbia. Additionally, Ms. Prescott has family in Columbia, and Ms. Tucker currently resides in Columbia. These factors suggest that Columbia has the most significant relationship to the parties and the marriage, and therefore, Columbia law should apply.

Second, filing in Columbia would provide certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result. If Mr. Hixon files in Columbia, there will be no question as to which state's law applies, and the parties will have a clear understanding of their rights and obligations. This will also promote uniformity of result, as the same law will be applied to both of Mr. Hixon's marriages.

Third, filing in Columbia would be easier for the parties and the court. Since both of Mr. Hixon's marriages were contracted in Columbia, and he and Ms. Tucker purchased property in Columbia, it would be easier for the parties and the court to gather and present evidence in Columbia. Additionally, since Ms. Tucker currently resides in Columbia, it would be more convenient for her to participate in the proceedings in Columbia.

2. Filing in Franklin

While there are some potential benefits to filing in Franklin, I believe that they are outweighed by the benefits of filing in Columbia. One potential benefit of filing in Franklin is that Mr. Hixon currently resides in Franklin, and it may be more convenient for him to participate in the proceedings in Franklin. However, as discussed above, Columbia has the most significant relationship to the parties and the marriage, and it would be easier for the parties and the court to gather and present evidence in Columbia.

Another potential benefit of filing in Franklin is that Franklin law may be more favorable to Mr. Hixon. However, it is important to note that the validity of a marriage is generally determined by the law of the state with the most significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage. In this case, that state is Columbia. Therefore, even if Mr. Hixon files in Franklin, it is likely that Columbia law will be applied.

Conclusion

Based on the above analysis, I recommend that Mr. Hixon file in Columbia. Columbia has the most significant relationship to the parties and the marriage, and filing in Columbia would provide certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result. Additionally, it would be easier for the parties and the court to gather and present evidence in Columbia. While there are some potential benefits to filing in Franklin, I believe that they are outweighed by the benefits of filing in Columbia.
