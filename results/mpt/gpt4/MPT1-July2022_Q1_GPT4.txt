Re: Walter Hixon matter

Issue: Does Columbia or Franklin law govern the grounds for annulling Mr. Hixon's marriage to Ms. Tucker?

Analysis:

The first step in determining which state's law governs the grounds for annulling Mr. Hixon's marriage to Ms. Tucker is to determine which state has the most significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage. Under the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws ยง 283, the validity of a marriage will be determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to the particular issue, has the most significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage under the principles stated in ยง 6. 

In this case, both Mr. Hixon and Ms. Tucker were residents of Columbia at the time of their marriage, and they purchased a house together in Columbia early in the marriage. These facts suggest that Columbia has a significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage. However, Mr. Hixon moved to Franklin a few years ago for a job opportunity, while Ms. Tucker remained in Columbia. This fact suggests that Franklin may also have a significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage.

To determine which state has the most significant relationship, we must consider the factors stated in Restatement ยง 6. These factors include the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue, the protection of justified expectations, certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result, and ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.

With respect to the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue, both Columbia and Franklin have legitimate policy interests in defining how a relationship as fundamental as marriage can be initiated and ended. However, the fact that Columbia and Franklin recognize different reasons for annulling a marriage indicates the strength of the policy interests involved. In this case, Columbia law permits annulment on the ground of fraudulent inducement, while Franklin law does not. This difference in the law suggests that Columbia has a stronger policy interest in the determination of the particular issue.

With respect to the protection of justified expectations, Mr. Hixon and Ms. Tucker married in Columbia, lived the majority of their married life there, and owned property together there. These facts strongly suggest that the parties had a justified expectation that Columbia law would govern the terms on which the marriage ended.

With respect to certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result, people often move between states, creating the need for a system of well-defined rules to govern which state's laws apply to the creation and termination of marriages. In this case, the fact that Mr. Hixon and Ms. Tucker were residents of Columbia at the time of their marriage and purchased a house together in Columbia early in the marriage suggests that Columbia law should apply to the creation and termination of their marriage.

With respect to ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied, all the important events in this marriage occurred in Columbia. Considerations of ease and administrative efficiency strongly suggest Columbia as the appropriate forum.

Conclusion:

Based on the factors stated in Restatement ยง 6, it appears that Columbia law should govern the grounds for annulling Mr. Hixon's marriage to Ms. Tucker. Columbia has the most significant relationship to the spouses and the marriage, and the relevant policies of Columbia, the protection of justified expectations, certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result, and ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied all support the application of Columbia law. Therefore, I recommend that we advise Mr. Hixon that Columbia law will likely govern the grounds for annulling his marriage to Ms. Tucker.
