MEMORANDUM

Re: Walter Hixon matter

I. Introduction

This memorandum addresses whether Mr. Hixon must file a lawsuit to annul his second marriage and, if so, whether he would be able to obtain an annulment under the applicable law. 

II. Analysis

A. Must Mr. Hixon file a lawsuit to annul his second marriage?

Under Franklin law, a marriage that is void does not require a judicial decree to end it. Franklin Domestic Relations Code ยง 19-5(a) states that certain marriages, including those where either party is lawfully married to another person, are void without the need for any decree of divorce, annulment, or other legal proceeding. 

However, under Columbia law, a marriage that is voidable requires a judicial decree to end it. Columbia Revised Statutes ยง 718.02 states that a marriage is voidable if the spouse of either party was living and the marriage with that spouse was then in force, and that spouse was absent and not known to the party commencing the proceeding to be living for a period of five successive years immediately preceding the subsequent marriage for which the annulment decree is sought. The statute further states that for a voidable marriage to be declared void, either party may seek and a court must issue an annulment decree.

Because Mr. Hixon's second marriage took place in Columbia and both he and Ms. Tucker resided in Columbia for the majority of their marriage, it is likely that Columbia law would apply to the question of whether Mr. Hixon must file a lawsuit to annul his second marriage. Therefore, Mr. Hixon would need to file a lawsuit to obtain an annulment of his second marriage under Columbia law.

B. Would Mr. Hixon be able to obtain an annulment under the applicable law?

Under Columbia law, Mr. Hixon would need to prove that his first wife, Ms. Prescott, was living and the marriage with her was then in force, and that she was absent and not known to him to be living for a period of five successive years immediately preceding his subsequent marriage to Ms. Tucker. 

Mr. Hixon has stated that he believed Ms. Prescott had died in 2001, eleven years before his marriage to Ms. Tucker. If he can provide evidence to support this belief, such as the testimony of the mutual friend who told him of Ms. Prescott's supposed death, he may be able to satisfy the requirement that she was absent and not known to him to be living for a period of five successive years immediately preceding his subsequent marriage.

However, Mr. Hixon would also need to prove that his marriage with Ms. Prescott was still in force at the time of his subsequent marriage to Ms. Tucker. This may be more difficult, as Mr. Hixon has stated that he and Ms. Prescott separated in 1990 and had no contact after that. It is possible that Ms. Prescott obtained a divorce or annulment without Mr. Hixon's knowledge, which would mean that their marriage was not in force at the time of his subsequent marriage to Ms. Tucker. Mr. Hixon would need to provide evidence, such as a search of divorce or annulment records, to prove that his marriage to Ms. Prescott was still in force at the time of his subsequent marriage to Ms. Tucker.

III. Conclusion

Based on the applicable law, Mr. Hixon would need to file a lawsuit to obtain an annulment of his second marriage under Columbia law. However, whether he would be able to obtain an annulment would depend on his ability to prove that his first wife was living and the marriage with her was then in force, and that she was absent and not known to him to be living for a period of five successive years immediately preceding his subsequent marriage to Ms. Tucker.
